## Education
### Lassonde School of Engineering, York University
#### Honours Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, class of 2025
- I go to Lassonde at York.

- I'm very happy with the friends and community I've been able to cultivate, and feel like I'm making the most out of my time here.


## Work Experience
### Scotiabank Software Engineering Intern
#### Velocity Program: Java Event Layer Team Jan-Apr 2024
- My Second Term at Scotiabank, moving from the IT team to the Digital Factory office down the street. My Lunchtime ping pong era has arrived.

- Working with Typescript and Playwright to do UI testing.


### Scotiabank DevOps Engineering Intern
#### Velocity Program: AppSec DevOps Team Sep-Dec 2023
- My first Internship at a big company!

- Worked on a Proof-of concept for a software system that automates the recording and displaying of software scan data.
### Software Engineering Intern

#### M5V Developments May-Aug 2023
- I spent this summer with M5V developments, helping design some innovations to their backend management and content creation workflows.

- I used Pytorch trained models to make video transcripts automatically, as well as used the openAI api to  automatically generate quizzes.

### Private Computer Science Instructor
#### Mar 2020-Present
-   I teach kids how to code (ages 9 -13)
    It's private classes to a group of home-schooled kids my Mom put me in contact with (thanks Mom).

- Teaching other people definitely helps show you the limits in your own understanding,  and has given me a stronger understanding of concepts fundamental to software development and computer science.

- That and being able to help my students overcome something they were struggling on is very gratifying :).

### Web Development Intern
#### Tunji Design Jun-Sep 2021
-   This was my first Internship. I had experience with wordpress and other CMS tools at the time and was given the opportunity to work with a web design company helping make website solutions for small businesses and charities.

## Projects
I have a [page](/projects) dedicated to those.

## Extra Curriculars
### Game Devs @ YorkU
#### Founder and President Nov 2021 - Present
- I started the game development club at York University, York was fully online at the time I had started there (Sept 2021), and I started the club through a mix of wanting to make friends and simply wanting to hang out in a game development club. There wasn't one so I decided to make one myself.

- I started by simply calling us an "unofficial club", and advertised it in existing clubs.

- Shockingly, people showed up! Enough for us to apply to be a real club.

- More than a year Later It's going much better than I could have ever imagined.
  We have a discord server of over 620 people, an executive team of 13, Workshops, Community events, and a video-game book club (the true voting class of GDYU).

- Check us out at [gdyu.club](https://www.gdyu.club/).

### Lassonde Freshman Week
#### Frosh Leader August 2022
- I was a frosh leader for the 2022 Lassonde freshman week.

-   It was a great time! It was nice taking on a leadership role and helping out the incoming students, I'm still friends with a lot of the people I had met too.

-   Wasn't able to do frosh the 2023 year, but if you get the chance then I really recommend it.
