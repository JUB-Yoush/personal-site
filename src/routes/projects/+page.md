# ~/projects

This page *had* a selection of my favorite/recent projects, but it was quite outdated.

I'll come up with a nicer view later, but for now:

<a href="https://github.com/JUB-Yoush/" target="_blank" >github</a>
<a href="https://yoush.itch.io/" target="_blank" >itch.io</a>

.project-header{
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    margin-bottom: .8rem;
    font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
