## Let me send you mail (please)!

I was trying to set up a self hosting mailing list, but setting up a mailserver, and everything else involved was a lot of work for something that could end up being used by like 5 people.

I'm not the biggest fan of SAAS conceptually (I enjoy owning and being in control of my tech), but [buttondown](https://buttondown.com/) seems pretty good actually, So I'll go with them for now.

So let me send you mail!

## FAQ:

### Why do I want to send you mail?

I wanted a way to publicly announce/share things on a system that I had control over. I didn't want to be beholden to an algorithm determining if people got my messages, or put my eggs in the basket of some platform that may not be around in a few years.

Email is utilitarian and boring, and the most boring and practical technology seem to stick around the longest. If I want to grow a stable and consistent group of people who are interested in being interested in the same things I'm interested in, an email list seems like the sensible option.

### What will I send, how often will I send it?

The mailing list will primarily be a way to notify people when new blog post or other interesting things I make release. I could also potentially do a Tom Scott style "here are cool things I checked out and recommend" as well.

I'll probably send one out perhaps every 2 months? I wouldn't want to make it too often and annoy people. If there's something special I'd like to share/announce then I might include an extra one outside that schedule.

I would've also wanted to have different tiers of subscribers, from "Send me an annual update" to "Send me anything whenever man I don't even care like-" but that'll have to wait until if/when I decide to upgrade buttondown tiers.

### What if I end up doing x and breaking your trust?

I solemnly vow to never:

- Sign someone up without their consent.
- Become a spam newsletter.
- Sell your email or other information.
- Do anything to make the experience of the mail subscriber worse for personal gain.

I hope you can trust me!
