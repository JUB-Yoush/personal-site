# What I've been up to (May 2025 - August 2025)

The summer is over with that I must abandon my hermit lifestyle and re-integrate into society. It was fun to simulate what it would be like to be self employed and work on my own schedule. Hopefully I'll be able to do that for real soon.

The work in question was mostly game development. If you've tuned into the [work streams](https://jaydenpb.net/blog/stream-faq) starting around June time you've likely saw me hacking away at that Roguelike. It's fun to completely dedicate yourself to a project and focus on nothing but your work for extended periods of time. I rarely find myself having to write code that is at the upper limit of my understanding of software architecture and design, but engine-less game programming has proven to be consistently challenging in a brain wrinkle forming way. It's also taught me a lot about the assumptions we make when it comes to writing code, been thinking a lot more critically of the common OOP patterns we were taught in class (you can see the article on [polymorphism](https://jaydenpb.net/blog/oop-1) for more about that).

Overall I am a much better but ironically less confident programmer after this summer, the more you know the more you realize you don't know.

I'll continue working on the game for sure, but I certainly won't be able to dedicate as much time as I had been to it. Planning on making it my first commercial game project (after I replace all the placeholder assets with ones I make myself). I'd also like to move this blog onto a bespoke static site generator written in something like Go instead of exporting a whole SvelteKit site would be much simpler.

For the final 4 months of 2025 I'd like to focus on resilience. I've found the best way to get something done is to sit down and chip away at it. I want to make sure I'm always consistent at the things I'd like to get done, but I find it very easy to throw away important habits when I'm not in "perfect" conditions, so being more flexible with how and when I can get things done will be important in actually getting them done.

But to finish it off, this is looking like my last year of school (hopefully), so I've been applying for new graduate jobs! If you want me to work for you, you're already on my website so you know where to find me, I talk about game development a lot but professionally I generally do full-stack development and Dev-Ops, see my resume. :)

Also, unfortunately this year I won't part of the team at GDYU. Factors involving personal and professional interpersonal conflict lead to this outcome, and things still aren't super amicable with me and some of leadership. There are still lots of good people in GDYU's exec team and community, so I still wish the club well despite what happened.

That's all, cheers!
