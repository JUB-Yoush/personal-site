I've been streaming myself working every weekday from around 9:30 to 6:00pm. I work in pomodoro sessions of 50 minutes of work followed by a 10 minute break. I've been doing this since May.

If [broadcasting myself working to an average of 0 viewers](https://www.youtube.com/@yoush2256/streams) seems like an odd habit, because it is. I don't do it with the hopes of becoming popular, it's value to me is giving me a structure in my life that I can orient my day around. Instead of my work being ad hoc and based on why whims. I wake up, eat breakfast, stream for 8 hours, then (hopefully) stop working for the day. For work that is currently operating entirely on intrinsic motivation (I'm not getting paid or reporting to anyone), this has been tremendously valuable in keeping me consistent, accountable and productive.

# FAQ

(will try to keep this up to date)

## "what do you work on?"

I usually start with writing my daily journal entry, doing a Leetcode problem (leetcode ðŸ¥€), and then spend the rest of the stream focused in on some programming related project I'm working through. Recently that's been building a roguelike game engine in C# with Raylib. Friday's I've recently started to dedicate to writing blog posts or sharing my work.

## "why do you eat chips with chopsticks"

So I don't get oily hands on my keyboard and trackball.
