# so how do *I* get into google?
- first part seems random

## cheap housing just sucks
## San jose state univerity housing kinda mid
## airbnb support kinda nice
## almost got arrested by the TSA
## 1. companies that are designed for developers will have good dev experience
- scotabank was a bunch of workarounds
- google was deisgned for people to write code
## 2. sports are fun?
- boxing/muay thai, bouldering, pickleball
## 3. sports are expensive
- you don't pay my sub
- rdxes off the ground
## 4. Katy Perry was right actually
- 10 concurrent crushes at a time
## 5. being at a place that makes doing your job easy makes you able to do harder work.
- I'm able to do more because doing things is easier
## 6. Good intranets are nice
- not suprising, moma my goat
## 7. free stuff is nice, mix max you're time here (thank you do everyone who dosen't use adblock)

## 8. walkable downtowns are loud

- if you like drinking or dancing to loud music then it's fine, otherwise you aren't missing out on much.
