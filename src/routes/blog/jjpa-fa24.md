Alright we're gonna keep this quick (as quick as it can be)

# what I'm up to for the rest of the year (Sept - Dec 2024)

## December is the deadline.
I promised someone very cool something very cool by the end of december. I'm not actually sure what that cool thing will be yet. But I'll decide it, and I'll share it with the cool person (and probably everyone else too).
It will probably be video game related. Although I'm not sure if it'll be one specific thing or a collection of things I've amassed throughout the 4 months. Not sure!

## "So, Exchange Time?"
I will not be going on exchange to Tokyo in the fall. It's Nihongover.
There are a few reasons to it, but there just kept being more and more things that were making it a less and less reasonable idea.
My courses weren't signed off on so the classes wouldn't count towards graduating, I had to pay an entire semester worth of tuition to york while trying to take a Ged-Ed requirement online, The semester at the exchange school ended in february, so I'd have to do the first month of my winter classes while I was there, I got into the bad dormitory, and as things went along it just felt like I was trying to force a square peg into a round hole. I really wanted to make it work despite it constantly working against me.

But life is (usually) long, and if I'm looking for them I'm sure I'll have more opportunities to visit and live in japan in the future. I'll try to at least vacation there next year.

But it doesn't mean Japanese language studying is also over, that's still going on. I had to take a bit of a break due to the final few weeks of the internship taking up a lot of my time, but I've been easing back into it. I hope to get back to full speed (and have a daily schedule that I can reasonably do every day) soon. Doing Bunpro and Wanikani and Kamesame SRS decks every day is kinda overwhelming, so I might try to pick some tools that I can do more consistently, SRS algorithms are hard to tune for different amounts of work, as they expect you to always do the amount of work they give you, and it's hard to tune them to do less, as you're reaping the reviews you sowed a while ago.

### Specific Goals:
- [ ] Come up with a primary daily study schedule as well as a modified one for when I have no time/energy that day
- [ ] Learn half of the N4 Grammar Points
- [ ] Get through all the lvl 0 Tadoku readers
- [ ] Reach WaniKani Level 22
- [ ] Check out York's Japanese student association, Try having a conversation in Japanese.

## Blog posts
I've been writing a whole lot recently, It's a great way to procrastinate! ðŸ¤“
I also write a lot of personal planners and notes, this is just the public stuff.
I want to write about a theory for cultivating deep understandings that I've been thinking about and wanted to give a try myself, I also wanted to write some posts reviewing some more books.
Finally I also wanted to update the post on game engines, as my opinions have changed.

Outside the blog itself, the site has some known issues I'd like to fix. RSS breaking is one of them.

### Specific Goals:
- [ ] Write post about Learning
- [ ] Write post about Books
- [ ] Update post about game engines
- [ ] Fix issues with site


## Health
### Physical
I was doing kickboxing training 2-3 times a week at Google, so hopefully I can keep that momentum to continue to workout here. York does have a Muay Thai community that I can hopefully train with. I've always struggled to set goals when it came to exercise. I think trying to reach certain calisthenics tricks could help, but I usually end up getting bored and unmotivated. I'll try to figure out how to fix that.

### Mental
I've been learning and practicing the concept of thoughts and actions being separate. Thoughts are thoughts, and actions are actions, thoughts can influence and motivate your actions, but they are inertly separate, and your actions are always separate decisions from your thoughts.

Your Feelings and your thoughts are also different (theory of the dog in me)

Also being on my own in california has helped me realize that I don't need nearly as much as I think I do. coming home to all this extra stuff was kinda overwhelming, I think practicing a bit more minimalism and trying to know how much is enough, not just having things for the sake of having them. I've listed a lot of my random unused things on facebook marketplace and am likely going to donate some of my clothes too.


### Sleep
I bought a Boox e-Reader finally, so I'm now able to read digital books without blasting myself with blue light. I have now attained the platonic ideal of being able to read until I'm tired, and if my current tossing and turning habits are any indication, I'll be able to get through a lot of books. ðŸ¤“

### Specific Goals:
- [ ] Wake up and go to sleep at the same time every day
- [ ] Read 5 Books!
- [ ] Set workout plan and stick to it
- [ ] Get rid of extra stuff you don't need, keep the stuff that's important

## GDYU
I am NOT the GDYU president this year. I am still an executive and as the founder I still do hold a unofficial authority, but it does allow me to focus less on administrative stuff and focus more on the qualities that I think I could excel at?

We have plans, plans I cannot share with you.

The plans I can share involve fixing Robo Scrimblo, he's been off for a while now and it's my fault, I'll get to him soon. "Fix Robo Scrimblo" is right under "Write JJPA" in my list of things to do, so it's happening ASAP.

### Specific Goals:
- [ ] Do the things (when they happen)
- [ ] Fix Robo Scrimblo

## School
I haven't been in classes since April of 2023. about 16 months of not being a student. I feel quite different then I did back then, and a lot has changed. I want to set up a new organization method for my notes and agenda using org mode, my raspberry pi server, syncthings, and my boox tablet (inspired by [absolutely no one](https://youtu.be/IZX-cDR6IQM?si=i3wqas16CFO5L259))

I also want to try making a pomodoro timer as a little pet project. I want to be able to set the timer from my watch, so making it based on an open API that I can connect other things to would be helpful for that.

I'd also like to get more strict about improving productivity through optimizing environmental factors. Just setting up more "focused mode" blockers to prevent any remaining distraction traps from getting me.

Hope I don't fail anything!

### Specific goals:
- [ ] Make a Pomodoro timer (or just modify an existing one to have the qualities you want)
- [ ] Set up new productivity system involving all your new toys
- [ ] Set up a focused mode on your devices to improve your ability to lock in
- [ ] Don't fail your classes

## game dev
It's [Bevy]() time.
I've been interested in this engine for a while an I'm taking this season to give it an honest try. I think it has a lot of qualities that make it appealing to my new perspective on software, and I've also met a few cool people who are involved with it.

The pre-requisite is to learn Rust, a language notorious for it's steep learning curve, Although from what I've done so far it doesn't' seem like it's super difficult to learn, it's just that going from one programming langue to another is generally pretty easy, Rust is just more different than usual.

but because of that, Rust has a ton of high quality learning materials, which make learning it a very good experience.

I will likely expand on my opinions on Bevy and how it compares to Godot in a separate post, I'll trying doing a [miziziziz split]() I'm excited! What's an ECS!?

### Specific Goals:
- [ ] Learn Rust
- [ ] Pariticpate in Ludum Dare 56?
- [ ] Make a 2 hour, 2 day, 2 week and 2 month game in bevy


## Art!?
I know. I do that.
I'll try to be going hard in pixel art, [pixel logic]() is a really cool book and I want to go through it and apply what it teaches.
Drawabox might also resume if that's the case, but no promises.
