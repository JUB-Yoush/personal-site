# Hi I make video games
- I'm a gamemaker hater
- gamemaker 8.1 war memories
- but lots of amazing games are made in it
- game engines don't matter but they do matter also
- the people who play your game dont' care about how it was made, doom is an engineering marvel yes, but it exploded not because it was so well made, but because it was really fun.
- the best engine is the one you know and that does what you need it to
- we're privlaged to live in a time where game development and engine development are seperate things
- in the dark ages making the games engine was just a part of development.
- it's never been easier to make a video game
- never been more choice in tools to use
- engines used to be bespoke, and built on a loss
- godot is the linux of game engines
- the different kinds of game engines
    - Foss and publishing locations + graphics and support
    - general engines vs specific engines
- scope vs complexity: the hard-ness of game dev
- scope: making the gameplay/levels
- complexity: making the game systems
- Rouge likes are high complexity but low scope, (the game makes itself) makes them a popular genre for indie devs
- rank games based on scope and complexity
- your engine influences complexity
- gamemaker makes making 2d game very easy and it's been around for a while so people know it
- godot sorta replaces gamemaker in terms of function and place in the market but ppl just stick 2 what they know

- the more assumptions your engine can make the less code you need to write yourself
- like renpy or rpgmaker
- general engines can only make general assumptions
- reasons to make your own engine is if your game has very specific needs that a general engine either prevent or don't help with
- less existing code means less code to understand before you know how to use the system, but you need to make the entire system
