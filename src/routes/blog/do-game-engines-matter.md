# Hi I make video games
- I'm a gamemaker hater
- game engines don't matter but they do matter also
- the best engine is the one you know and that does what you need it to
- it's never been easier to make a video game
- never been more choice in tools to use
- the different kinds of game engines
    - Foss and publishing locations + graphics and support
    - general engines vs specific engines
- scope vs complexity: the hard-ness of game dev
- scope: making the gameplay/levels
- complexity: making the game systems
- Rouge likes are high complexity but low scope, (the game makes itself) makes them a popular genre for indie devs
- rank games based on scope and complexity
- your engine influences complexity
- gamemaker makes making 2d game very easy and it's been around for a while so people know it
- godot sorta replaces gamemaker in terms of function and place in the market but ppl just stick 2 what they know

- the more assumptions your engine can make the less code you need to write yourself
- like renpy or rpgmaker
- general engines can only make general assumptions
- reasons to make your own engine is if your game has very specific needs that a general engine either prevent or dont help with
- less existing code means less code to understand before you know how to use the system, but you need to make the entire system
