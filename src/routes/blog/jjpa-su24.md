# Google has submsumed me and everything revolves around them.

I am writing this in a hotel in Milpitas california. 

I'll be working at Google for the summer, at the Sunnyvale office, I'm on the cloud workspace team responsible for Gmail and Chat. Things were quite fast from the offer acceptance to the start of my first day, and everything I had talked about in the previous one of these has fallen through the cracks to some degree.

But first some logistics:
## JJPA changes:
- these will now be every 4 months, to better match the academic calendar.
- they'll also generally be shorter, I'd like this blog to be information that is broadly interesting and applicable, not just things for people who are interested in me speficifally.

## Throw out everything I had said in the last one of these. 
Honestly I don't think I actually looked at the goals I had set after writing them this time. My days were spent refreshing my email to wait for more information from Google or the Visa issuing company. Things from there that I was able to do are the following:

- Finalized my summer internship at Google.

- Finsished up my term at scotiabank. It wasn't very remarkable, but I think Google will make up for that.

- Christna and Kaisaan will be taking over GDYU in my absence, it's nice to know the club dosen't require me to keep funcitoning. Most York Clubs don't outlive their founder graduating, hopefully we beat those allegations.

- I've been consistent with WaniKani, put it on pause to travel but got back to it after around 2 weeks.

- GDYU bot and GDYU website are live.

- I've remade my site, it's static and hosted on github pages now.

- Drawing and working out did get put on the back burner as they all to commonly do.

- I did finish a game development project! It was a collaberative project with some gdyu members. I was always aprehensive to try collaberative projects with the club, and we did run into a lot of the problems I had predicted we would, but overall I had a good time and would be down to try it again

## A very Googley summer
I'm likey not going to make much progress on personal learning goals or hobbies this summer. 

I'm going to be primarily focused on work and doing new things with new people. Part of me does feel bad "abandoning" the habits I've cultivated for so long, but I think giving myself the oppertunity to live differently while I have an opptertunity to try lots of different things is worth doing. It's taken a lot of grinding and hard work and consistency to get the oppertunity to do these things, so I'm going to try to make the most of them.

I'll have the rest of my life to draw comics and make games and do whatever else I'd like to, but I'll only have this summer to be an intern at google (unless they give me a return internship/full time offer??? ðŸ˜³)

So for Goals this summer, I'd just like to do my best and make the most of my oppertunites here. 

And you go make the most of your oppertunties! Wherever and whenever you are!

Bye!
