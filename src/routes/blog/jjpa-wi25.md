- blog isn't dead
- the last 4 months were pretty bad
- the game development was good
- too much hubris and pride
- I need to admit my fault and work to improve it
- these updates don't work very well, these goals are usually written and then ignored.
- There still a gap between the person I think I am and the person who I actually live like. I need to accept that.
  - personality test paradox
- I need to build a strong foundation.
- I can't build towers in a marsh, need to make more solid ground first.
- I'm too quickly trying to become a master, I have my entire life to get a grip on these concepts
- I need to pick things that are practical, actionable, able to be maintained, and don't just sound good on paper.
- I'm making a few fundamental goals based on the fundamentals as outlined by scott in his course that was very expensive and I didn't get.
- list out the fundies
- I also want to get into the habit of things, daily game dev was great, I want more of that.
- hours are just time, and it's a flawed metric to measure your skill at something. If I spent 10000 hours simply holding a violin without doing anything, or just practicing the c major scale repeatedly, I'm not going to be a master.
- but time is a prerequisite to skill, the quality of your practice increases or decrases the time required, but time will always exist.
- focus on doing things, once you've gotten the doing part down, try to organize how you spend that time better.
- there's also this blog. I want this blog to be more generally valuable, and not just a way for me to publicly write about myself and feel important. expect shorter, more specific, and more potentially helpful posts in the future. less about me and more about my work (which I will be doing a lot more of in the new year)
- I also added a mailing list to the site! look on that page for the what/when/why.

What I'm up to from jan - april

- classes
- winter term project w GDYU
- not neglecting the fundamentals,
