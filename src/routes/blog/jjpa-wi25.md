# Blog isn't dead!

It's been about 4 months since the last blog post. After careful end of year reflection and going over my daily journal entries, I can say fairly confidently that these last 4 months were the worst 4 months of my life.

Now that sounds very extreme, but it wasn't something suddenly awful befalling me, just a lot of things not going the way I wanted them to despite me trying my hardest to get them to work out. Part of me is quite privileged and lucky that these last 4 months have been the worst my life has ever gotten, as it wasn't _that_ bad. But regardless of the severity of badness which I won't get into (consider it a exercise for the reader), I survived, and am better off for it.

It wasn't all bad though, being back at school let me hang out with my friends, I learned that an friend was keeping up with me through reading my blog (it still is surprising whenever I'm reminded of the people who actually read this blog. Thank you all). And I did a lot of game development! I simply tried to do a little bit of development every day and it compounded to my biggest and stupidest project yet! It'll be out soon, taking a little break for the holidays.

I've also been reflecting on productivity and goal setting. I think I struggle from what I like to call the personality test problem, which is: the person who you think you are and the person who you actually are are generally different to varying degrees. Taking a personality test is you describing the person you think you are, not the person you actually are.

I wanted to be someone who was organized and productive and who accomplished a lot, but my day to day habits didn't reflect this. My work was very ad hoc and disorganized. I couldn't even tell you what I set my fall goals to be.

I too quickly wanted to be someone who knew what they were doing, my goal is to inspire others to live more focused, directed, and intentional lives, but I wasn't able to do this myself yet. the fundamentals of my lifestyle and habits weren't strong enough to support my ambitious goals. There's a gap between the person I am and the person I want to be. It's like trying to build a house in mud, no matter how motivated you are to build the house, if you don't have the foundation to support it, then it's not going to reach being built.

This is what I'd repeatedly do, I'd try to build a house, it wouldn't be finished, I would try building another, ironically more ambitious house, and it wouldn't be finished either. That's kinda how I've went 5 years of making video games and never really releasing anything.

So what are these "Fundamentals"? Well there is no concrete definition of the basics of living a good life, but [Scott H Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/) does have a pretty good list he came up with (somehow) and used for this really expensive course aptly titled "Foundations"

They are:

1. Fitness: Physical Fitness.
2. Food: Eating.
3. Sleep: Sleeping
4. Productivity: How much you get done.
5. Focus: Deep work.
6. Organization: How you keep track of what you're doing.
7. Reading: Reading
8. Reflection: Thinking about yourself and other things
9. Money: Money
10. Outreach: Meeting new people.
11. Connection: Fostering connections and relationships deliberately
12. Service: Giving back to others.

I like this list. It seems pretty all encompassing, and all of these things are things I think everyone needs to consider.

My Goals for the winter (which I won't list out unlike previous seasons), will all be based in fostering solid foundations that will allow me to build all the houses I'd like to have and demonstrate to others.

I would also like to focus on action over planning. Daily game dev showed me how rewarding and motivating small progress over a while can be, hopefully I can maintain more of that feeling.

## What I'm up to from jan - april

I have classes. They should hopefully be better than my fall ones, I have good professors for all of them as far as anecdotal evidence and RMP is concerned.

GDYU is becoming an indie studio and producing a project for [Level up Student showcase 2025](https://levelupshowcase.com/) (assuming we're able to get a table). Optimistic about it and it'll certainly take up a lot of my time this season.

But Overall I'll be taking it slow. Focusing on building intentional, deliberate, and lifelong habits that will help me out in the long run.

As for the blog, I'm going to try out some shorter, more specific and to the point style posts, they shouldn't take nearly as long to make, and would just be based on a single idea or concept.

Thanks for reading, hope your holidays are holly and jolly
