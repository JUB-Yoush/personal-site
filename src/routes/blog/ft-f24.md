# My Favorite things from the last 3 months (September 2024 - December 2024)


## [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/)
Arcane is incredibly pretty to look at. So pretty that it's the first show I wanted to get the blu-ray release for to watch it without Netflix video compression. The first season in 2021 and other contemporaries like Spiderverse did kickstart the 3d animation trying to emulate the style of 2d animation. Spiderverse uses descrete frame-by-frame animation, while arcane went with 3d models with hand painted textures. I'm obviously in love with the 3d returning to 2d renaissance, with places like Arcsys doing the same for video games.

But what about Arcane as a show?

The first season makes good writing look so easy, nothing is particularly new or original about arcane, protagonists on opposite sides of a conflict, prospering and impoverished cities, they're all tropes we've seen before. but they just do such a good job at it all that it stays engaging and captivating. Perfect TV show. No notes.

Season 2 is also incredible but feels rushed in the back half. It feels like we're getting the highlight reel while skipping all the "unnecessarily but still would've been cool to see" stuff. I'm sure they had a hard cutoff of 9 episodes, and it feels like they kept only what they had to, to make as much story as they could, but part of me wishes for an extended cut of the show to later be released.

Watch Arcane! It's incredibly good! No I won't get me to play league, [We're wise to your tricks, Riot.](https://gamerant.com/arcane-success-new-league-of-legends-players-underwhelming/)


## [2XKO](https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/)

I got into the alpha lab in august and had a good time. 2XKO is very loose and expressive. It's a classical tag fighter with abhorrent mixups and 40 second long combos (which they're working on toning down). They don't make em like this anymore.

It's interesting that the commitment to 1 button special moves over traditional motion inputs lead to them increasing the game speed from a mid paced 1v1 game (as seen in the earliest footage) to a fast and loose 2v2 game. 1 button special moves become more powerful the *slower* your game is. In anime and tag games, you aren't using a dragon-punch as a anti-air, it's usually just used as reversal on wake up. Tag games provide so much more to consider that the speed of your special move inputs is less important. 

Additionally, the introduction of Duo's mode where two people on both sides control both characters influences the decision to make the game 2v2, but use a round system. This was put in place to prevent the other player who got TODed by Ahri midscreen fireball starter to not have nothing to do for an entire game.

It feels loose in all the ways our favorite old japanese fighting games were, but not kusoge. The characters are all expertly crafted by game designers far smarter than myself. They do have the cannon bro's on the team, we knew we were in good hands but it's nice to finally get to play it.

I'm sorta in a holding pattern until I can play again. Ekko Yasuo was my team if you were curious.

## [Pinecil Soldering Iron](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/)

- Isn't it the cutest lil thing?

## [UFO 50](https://50games.fun/)

Derek Yu and friends make 50 new NES games, and they're all good. They aren't actual NES games, they were made in gamemaker, The Game "The Big Bell Race" even features inconsistent pixel sizes... Dead giveawayðŸ¤“. 

But they aren't trying to trick you or anything, the games are actually for a fantasy console called the LX. It catalogs a fake company named "UFOsoft" and the games they made between 1984 - 1989.
These are full sized games too (relative to contemporaries in the era). There's a full 20 hour cowboy JRPG in there too.

The game more interesting, novel, and fun ideas than a 2d mario game. It's interesting to me because it shows how most games can be stripped down to their fundamentals and still retain most of their fun. 80% of the fun of any game comes from 20% of it's mechanics? 

Big recommendation if you're a game developer who feels creatively bankrupt. Or struggles to come up with small game-jam sized ideas.

## [Metaphor Re: Fantazio](https://www.mobygames.com/game/231733/metaphor-refantazio/)

- Metaphor is the Lost Odyessy of Atlus JRPGs.
- It feels like they took good ideas across their entire catalog and cobbled them together into a new game.
- You got the persona calendar and social stat system, the SMT press-turn combat system, Etrian Odyessy Classes, and a Job system reminicient of Final Fatasy Tactics, a game you all know I enjoy quite a bit.
- I'm not too far in, but I've been having a good time! JRPGs have always been a comfort genre for me, and Metaphor is a lot of stuff I like in one package.

## I thrifted a sick jacket
- That's all.

## The very nice brampton drivetest receptionist

- She was very kind and it made me feel very nice.
- Be kind out there everyone.

## Imonay "Monday Korean" Korean

- Korean restaurant on Bloor street in koreatown.
- very big portions relative to the price, food was also really good.

## Sonic 3

- Hype moments and aura
- if these movies came out like 10 years ago I would've been estatic
- I had to grow in up the DARK AGES, playing on a WII U.
- These kids get mario AND sonic movie franchises???

## E.Y.E: Eternity You'll Earn

- I'm a big fan of Lusa and her extravagant and detailed presentation and polish in her projects, EYE is no different.
- At it's core it's a cookie clicker. But the surrounding aestethics and wouldbuilding and characterization help you feel investested in what functionally is clicking on cookies.
- I want to open that gate! ...should I want to open that gate?

## Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue and Tokyo Godfathers

- Good movies

## Marvel Rivals
- GDYU 6 stack
- not sure if I like hero shooters from a competitve perspective, 
- I don't play esports other than fighting games
