# Was Tetris... inevitable?
If Alexey Pajitnov hadn't created the game circa 1984, would somebody else have instead?

Of course you can ask this question of any video game, or any innovation in anything. But Tetris stands out to me as an game worth asking this questions about because Tetris is so... Perfect.

Tetris was complete the day it came out. A few simple ideas came together to create a game that was so simple but so innovate, understood in an instant but could be enjoyed for a lifetime. All of it's few systems work perfectly with one another to make a game where there isn't really anywhere left to take it. The Tetris of 1984 is effectively the Tetris of today, with little modification. Tetris was and continues to be, a perfect video game. Tetris is the final form of itself.

I'll be the first person to tell you that ideas don't spawn out of the ether from nothing, and we can trace back the origin of Tetris to math concepts and Pajitnov playing with Tetromino puzzles as a child, but something about it's simplicity and elegance makes it feel like it just manifested completely finished out of the primordial soup. I can't imagine a world without Tetris, it feels so obvious. How many more Tetrises are there? How many more genres of games are there that nobody has thought to make yet? Do other games have a platonic ideal, a final form that it's waiting to achieve?

As game designers, we push the bounds of what we know to be possible, but we also focus in on and refine the things we already know are possible, in an effort to make even more fun, engaging, interesting, and good.

I have broadly categorized these two types of thinking into honing and innovating.

the rest of the blog post will just be me talking about this concept.

Let's talk about shmups.

## Shmups are Simple.
They're what a "shooter" used to be before DOOM. You dodge the bullets that come from the top of the screen and shoot up back at the things shooting at you. Sure there are evolutions to the genre like twin stick and 3d-rail shooters, but let's stick to classic shmups.

Shmups are also a Dead Genre (my definition being that Large AAA studios no longer make games in that genre.), but In 1998 Shmups weren't dead! They were just.. almost dead. 

The Tokyo based game studio Treasure released Radiant Silvergun to Japanese Arcades (Later ported to the Sega Saturn, and modern consoles later). They took what they knew worked from the long lineage of existing shmup, and honned the ideas present throughout the genre to create what many consider to be the best shmup ever.

## a description of radiant silvergun.
Radiant Silvergun is a big ol juicy game filled with a lot of things. 

it's a shmup that features 6 different types of shots: 
- a straight cannon 
- homing laser 
- side bombs 
- rear shots
- lightning beams 
- homing missiles

You have 3 separate weapon levels. through use (and through your boss destroy percentage), the weapons become more powerful by leveling up. You also having a "Radiant sword" which allows you to nullify pink "sword bullets" that build up your swords meter. at max meter, your sword becomes a giant cleave that gives you full invincibility throughout the animation.

There is also a combo system. Enemies are either red blue or yellow. Only Kill enemies of the same color to increase your chain. There are also occasionally "secret" chains in certain sections of levels that require you to kill enemies in specific color orders.

There is a lot to rs, and there are other miscelenious detials I left out. The game is formed through a lot of different, seeming separate systems that all come together through genius design to create one of the best shmups of all time. (It's really good) it's on steam now! play it!

but with the peak of shmups being achieved, where would treasure go from here? rs is filled to the brim, they took everything from the genre they knew worked, and honned it into the perfect form of itself. they couldn't make a sequel with more systems to try and fold into all the existing ones.

so instead of honing any further, they innovated.

In 2001, Treasure released *Ikaruga*.

## "Oh, that's the one were you switch colours right!?"
If that was the thought that occurred to you when you read Ikaruga (or clicked on the mobygames link and saw screenshots of it), then that's kinda indicative of the point that this post is about. Ikaruga is a very odd yet very simple shmup that is designed around one mechanic.

## every single mechanic in Ikaruga
- everything is either white or black. you can swap your ship between white mode and black mode. 
- you absorb same color bullets opposite colour bullets kill you.
- you have one type of shot. You deal double damage by shooting enemies with the opposite color.
- you have a missile barrage (good ol [itano circus]()) that you can fire by spending a your absorbed bullets.
- enemies of the same color as you return fire upon death.
- kill enemies in groups of 3 of the same color to maintain your combo and increase your score. you get an extra life every 3 million points (and every 5mil after that).

thats *every mechanic* in the game

It did take the geniuses who came up with rs to later then not only come up with the idea for ika conceptually. Anyone can go "let's make a color swapping shooter", but coming up with every single specific mechanic in ika around the concept of a color swapping game that lend themselves to the design of:

- Enemies sending return fire obviously allows you to gain charge through killing enemies, but more subtly it also makes you think before shooting, as shooting a same color enemy then swapping will cause you to get hit by the bullets you had gotten sent out.
- Dealing double damage to opposite color enemies greatly increases risk/reward, as you cannot absorb their shots.
- the charge missles is much more powerful than your standard shot, so thinking about how you'll absorb bullets to get the charge, and when to release it, are factors in thinking about positioning and about what color to be.
- the comboing system is the most elegant addition, and is an interesting point of comparison from this to rs. in rs, combing is also well designed and thought out and fun, but it is arbitrary. enemies are 1 of 3 colors for the sake of comboing, it's just one seperate system in a game full of seperate systems that all come together. ika ties combing directly into it's central mechanic of colors. enemies aren't black or white to be combo'ed, they're black and white because that's what the entire game is about, comboing is simply a natural extension of the existing color system. (that and the devs thought having you ignore 2/3rds of the enemies on the screen for your score felt bad)
- Colors and comboing alo help with making how you route your kills across a stage tremendously important, to try and maintain a combo throughout the stage. People sometimes call Ikaruga a puzzle game, because of the way you need to figure out the "perfect" way to go though each level.  

Ikaruga on the surface might appear to be quite similar to other shmups, I thought so as well when drafting up this post. But through a more nuanced understanding you realize that most of the similarities between these games were surface level. 

"Ikaruga is a innovating on shmups while rs is honning in on shmups" but Ikaruga in it's innovating ends up becoming radically different comapred to other shmups. It's far more methodical, more puzzle-esque, it's not about reacting to enemy patterns in quick sucsession, it's about solving the many puzzles the game throws at you involving spread patterns, return fire, combo routing, and when to switch. 

Ikaruga isn't just "double the number of bullets on the screen and make half of them a different color", having the player be able to essentially switch between two different states of bullet location at any time means that the way you prepare bullet patterns fundamentally changes. You can't really take patterns and enemies from rs and throw them in ikaruga and expect it to work.

Ikaruga is a game who's design is based solely around one idea or mechanic. rs by comparison is much less focused and is simply really hecking well put together dispite having nothing to frame itself around, no north star, it just balls.


A novelty game would be something like: Superhot. while A non-novelty game would be something like Ultrakill. Ultrakill has some of the best enemy, level, and weapon design of any game literally ever. but it's not focused around a specific mechanic or thing you can do. The style meter is novel, but the entire game dosen't revolve around it. you could take (almost any of) the pieces of ultrakill out and the game would be *relativley* the same. A great example that illustrates that is the Sentry Enemy. 

## Thinking about the sentry in Ultrakill:
For those who haven't played Ultrakill: ...why not? what's wrong with you? 

For those who have played it or just bought it and are waiting for it to download: Sentries are a type of enemy in Ultrakill that lock onto you and fire a hitscan bullet after a certain amount of time. you can disable the sentry and reset the lock-on timer in a myriad of ways including:
- Ground Slam
- Sniping the antenna shots from hitscan weapons.
- Knuckleblaster punch.
- Malicious Railcannon.
- Cannonball
- Jackhammer

A seemingly random collection, with no pattern as to why some things work and others don't. however, if you've played ultrakill, these options all feel like the're reasonable selections and fit well within the design of the game, and combat encounters with sentries are all designed around these being the options to disable them. Taking one away wouldn't *completely* ruin the game, but find a better way to finish this sentence.

Superhot is obviously much more focused than Ultrakill, it's based on a single mechanic (Time moves only when you do), and it's good and things break if you take them out.

## Honers vs Innovators
This novelty style of thinking is very common among indie developers. Making a game in an existing genre with 1-2 primary gimmicks has simpler complexity, and the scope is generally lower. I could only imagine having the frame of reference of "color swapping" made coming up with levels for Ikaruga to be easier than working with "make it good" for rs. 

it's also hard to make new an interesting things in a existing genre without having something to frame your thinking around, espeically for indies who a lot of are new/hobbist/don't have the years of experince required to pull a rs out of their consious (Hakita is an exception to this rule. He just tracends that ida glass quote)

most indies also look for novel ideas to innovate and work on their complexity design skills. scope design skills are something else that's relevant and sometimes neglected. how many of your jam projects end up being 1-2 levels? your games innovative systems are only as good as the environments and situations you give your player to use those systems within.

we already know FPSes or platformers are good, but what about when we add new thing to it?

there is be value in simply taking the complexity that's already been figured out by existing games, and making new scope for it.

you already know the idea inheritly works, so you need to make levels that can demonstrate the idea working. Games like Celeste for example don't really do anything new, they just do things very well.

complexity can be perfectly designed, but scope cannot. 

Making perfect systems is much easier than making perfect levels. I don't know how we could even begin to judge that. Tetris is perfect, tetris is novel. Ikaruga and superhot are also novel, and they're very good, but they aren't perfect. they can't be because they have levels.

Novelty based design also helps your game be... novel. which is helpful for being interesting, and for marketing. remember how you remembered ikaruga as "that color swapping shmup"? It immedetly gives ika a place to live where it's not as closley directly competing with other things

not to say that parking your boat next to existing ones (link to that boat metaphor video) isn't inherently a bad idea, but it makes it harder for you to demonstrate why people should play your game instead of the existing games there. especially when your game sucks lol.

Okay that's it?

Time to edit this mess together and make it coherent.
