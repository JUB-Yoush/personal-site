# My Favorite things from the last 3 months (March 2024 - May 2024)

## [Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/)

- arcane pretty asf
- I wanted to get the bluray to watch it without Netflix video compression
- this plus spiderverse did push the 3d animation taking elements from 2d animation and putting them back
- spiderverse uses frame-by-frame animation, while arcane went with 3d models with hand painted textures
- I'm obviously in love with the 3d returning to 2d rennesance, with places like Arcsys doing the same for
  video games.
- but what about arcane as a show?
- the first season makes good writing look so easy, nothing is particulary new or original about arcane, siblings on opposite sides of a conflict, two sister cities, they're all tropes we've seen before. but they just do such a good job at everything.
- the 1st season is perfect, season 2 is also incredible but feels very rushed in the back half. things they do for a single episode could've been an entire arc. It feels like we're getting the hilight reel while skipping all the fluff. There's definetly stuff that they cut, and I wish we could've gotten another set of 3 episodes to give things a bit more time to breathe.
- But isn't everyone making Jinx fan-cams on tiktok (i'm could only assume so.) so you probably don't need me to tell you to watch it.
- it's incredibly good, won't get me to play leauge (we're all wise to your tricks riot)
- One game riot will get me to play is...

## 2KXO

- I got into the beta
- it's really good
- very loose, very expressive
- they don't make fighting games like these anymore?
- sorta in a holding pattern until I can play again, not sure what else to check out
- it's american but the game _feels_ japanese when it's in ya hands
- Ekko Yasuo was my team, didn't try out 2v2 unfortunatley

## Pinecil soldering iron

- isn't it the cutest lil thing?

## UFO 50

- Derek Yu and friends make 50 new NES games, and they're all good.
- They aren't actual NES games, they were made in gamemaker, The Game "The Big Bell Race" even features inconsistent pixel sizes... Dead giveawayðŸ¤“.
- But they aren't trying to trick you or anything, the games are actually for a fantasy console called the LX. It catalogs a fake company named "UFOsoft" and the games they made between 1984 - 1989.
- These are full sized games too (considering the time of release). There's a full 20 hour cowboy JRPG in there too.
- The game has as many interesting, novel, and fun ideas as a 2d mario game. It's interesting to me because it shows how most games can be stripped down to their fundamnetals and still retain most of their fun. 80% of the fun of a game comes from 20% of it's mechanics?
- Big recomendation if you're a game developer who feels creativley bankrupt. Or can't come up with small game-jam sized ideas.

## Metaphor Re: Fantazio

- Metaphor is the Lost Odyessy of Atlus JRPGs.
